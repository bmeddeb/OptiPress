# OptiPress Library Organizer - Project Summary

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: 📋 Planning Complete - Ready for Development

---

## What We've Created

Based on extensive research of existing WordPress file management plugins (Download Monitor, WP Download Manager, WP File Download, etc.), we've designed a comprehensive library organizer system for OptiPress that will enable photographers and researchers to manage their advanced format images professionally.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### ✅ Parent-Child Custom Post Types

We chose **Download Monitor's proven pattern**:
- `optipress_item` (parent) - Logical image entity
- `optipress_file` (child) - Individual file variants

**Why?**
- Each file is a first-class entity
- Easy to query and manage
- Enables per-file tracking
- Leverages WordPress core
- REST API ready

**Example Structure**:
```
Item #100: "Sunset at Beach"
├── File #101: IMG_5847.CR2 (original, 5.2 MB)
├── File #102: preview.webp (preview, 181 KB)
├── File #103: thumb-300x300.webp (thumbnail, 15 KB)
├── File #104: medium-1024x768.webp (medium, 85 KB)
└── File #105: large-2048x1536.webp (large, 220 KB)
```

### ✅ Four Taxonomies for Organization

1. **optipress_collection** (hierarchical) - Folder structure
2. **optipress_tag** (non-hierarchical) - Flexible tagging
3. **optipress_access** (non-hierarchical) - Permission levels
4. **optipress_file_type** (non-hierarchical) - Format classification

### ✅ Custom Tables for Performance

- `wp_optipress_downloads` - Download tracking/logging
- `wp_optipress_file_versions` (future) - Version history

### ✅ File System Organization

```
wp-content/uploads/optipress/
└── collections/
    └── {collection-slug}/
        └── {item-id}/
            ├── original/
            ├── preview/
            └── sizes/
```

---

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Upload RAW Image
1. User uploads `IMG_5847.CR2` via WordPress media uploader
2. OptiPress detects advanced format
3. Creates `optipress_item` post
4. Stores original in organized directory
5. Advanced_Formats creates WebP preview
6. Thumbnailer creates sizes
7. Each file stored as `optipress_file` child post
8. Metadata extracted and stored
9. Auto-assigned to "Recent Uploads" collection
10. Ready to organize, tag, and share

### Workflow 2: Organize Library
1. User navigates to "OptiPress → Library"
2. Sees grid of images with thumbnails
3. Creates collection "2025 Portfolio → Landscapes"
4. Drag-and-drop images into collection
5. Adds tags: "sunset", "beach", "HDR"
6. Sets access level: "Public"
7. Saves changes
8. Collection structure visible in sidebar

### Workflow 3: Download Original
1. Visitor views image on site (via shortcode)
2. Clicks "Download Original (5.2 MB)"
3. OptiPress checks permissions
4. Generates secure time-limited token
5. Serves file via PHP handler
6. Logs download (user, IP, time)
7. Increments download counter
8. File delivered securely

### Workflow 4: Bulk Management
1. User selects 50 images
2. Bulk action: "Move to Collection"
3. Selects "Client Work → Project Alpha"
4. AJAX processing with progress bar
5. All items moved
6. Success notification

## Migration Strategy

### From Current OptiPress to Organizer

**Compatibility**: 100% backward compatible

1. **Detection**: Scan for attachments with `original_file` meta
2. **Conversion**:
   - Create `optipress_item` for each
   - Create `optipress_file` for original
   - Create `optipress_file` for preview
   - Link relationships
   - Preserve metadata
3. **Organization**: Auto-assign to "Migrated Items" collection
4. **Verification**: All existing images still work
5. **Cleanup**: Optional - remove old meta after verification

**Timeline**: Migration runs in background via AJAX, ~100 items/minute

## Questions for Discussion

### Architecture
1. Should we use one or two custom tables? (Currently: 1 main + 1 optional)
2. File system: keep current structure or move to organized dirs immediately?
3. Migration: automatic on upgrade or manual via admin page?

### Features
4. Phase 1-2 vs Phase 3-4: which features are MVP?
5. Should we build minimal UI first or full-featured from start?
6. Shortcodes in Phase 6 - can we defer further?

### Development
7. Single developer or team? (affects timeline)
8. Release strategy: beta testers before public?
9. Versioning: OptiPress 0.7.0 or OptiPress Pro 1.0?

### User Experience
10. Default behavior: organize all images or opt-in per image?
11. Collection names: "Collections" vs "Folders" vs "Albums"?
12. Should existing users be forced to migrate or is it optional?
